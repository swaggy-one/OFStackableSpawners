# OFStackableSpawners
Originally developed by Orbitium
Being added to by me as I learn Java.

**Used and made for `hardcore.CapstoneMC.net`**

Similar to DonutSMP spawners. They stack and are fully GUI based.
Rates and messages are fully customizable. Even has a playtime restriction on breaking.
Also introduces silk-touch requirements for pickup.

You can sell items, open a spawner inventory, and take XP from them.
It sells item storage by hooking into Essentials and using its worth.yml list.

> When you mine a spawner while sneaking/crouching, it drops a singular one.

> When you mine a spawner without crouching, it drops them all.

> Without silk touch, you just destroy the spawners.
